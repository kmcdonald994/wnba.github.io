                <p>During the WNBA finals in 2020, there was an average of 440,000 people watching (Nemchock, 2020) while the NBA finals in 2020 had an average of 7.5 million people watching (Palmeri, 2020). This difference in viewership plays a big part in the huge pay gap between the two leagues. It is not just on TV or online that there is a big difference in viewers. The average physical attendance of NBA games is almost triple that of the WNBA, with the NBA having an average of 18,000 viewers in the stadium compared to an average of 6,768 for the WNBA (Jope, 2019).</p>
                 
                <p>    
                Tickets to WNBA games are by far the cheaper of the two. The ticket price is only $17.42 while tickets for NBA games cost a huge $89.00 (Jope, 2019). The low-ticket price as well as low attendance means that the WNBA only brings in $117,898.56 per game from ticket sales. The NBA on the other hand has a lot more viewers with a much higher price, meaning they bring in around $1,602,000. This means the NBA brings in more than 13x what the WNBA does from ticket sales.

                <p>Viewership is obviously part of the reason that athletes in the leagues are paid so differently. Lowering the ticket price clearly is not enough to bring more people in so the league needs to focus on other ways of increasing viewers, the two ways I see are to increase advertising and to make the games more exciting. The NBA puts money into the WNBA to keep it running but if they put a little extra into the league to boost advertising for a few years, it could be enough to make the league self-sufficient. </p>
                
                <p>For any sport, one of the main sources of income is sponsors. This is no different for basketball. Both the NBA and WNBA are sponsored by huge names like Google, Nike and Gatorade. With the two leagues sharing many of the same sponsors there is not much that can change with sponsors to decrease the pay gap. Most WNBA teams already have a company’s logo on their jerseys and ads are run through the breaks in games. Sponsor money will increase alongside viewership. </p>
