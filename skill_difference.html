                <p>While it is not an essential part of basketball, slam dunking creates excitement within games and happens all the time during NBA matches however there have only ever been 7 players in the WNBA that could dunk over the past 24 years (Queen Ballers Club, 2020). The difference in dunking is not necessarily down to skill though. 
                    
                The average height of an NBA player is 6 feet 6 inches (Curcic, 2021) while the average height of a WNBA player is 5 feet 9 inches (Queen Ballers Club, 2020). Due to the height difference, it would make sense for the rim to be lowered for WNBA games. This would drastically increase the number of dunks per game and would allow the players to go for more exciting dunks, which would make the games more fun to watch.  </p>

                <p>When it comes to scoring statistics there actually is not a very noticeable gap in skill. The league averages for the two leagues are similar. When comparing the percentage of shots that went in, the WNBA hit 44.51% on average (Oddshark, 2021), while the NBA only hit 2% more of their shots with an average of 46.5% going in (Basketball Reference, 2021).</p>
                    
                <p>A lot of other statistics are similar between the two leagues other than the score which is only lower due to each game only being 40 minutes in the WNBA compared to the NBA’s 48-minute games. 
            
                Although comparing average stats does not show much of a difference, there is a skill gap when it comes to the best players from each league. Although the WNBA only started in 1997 it has yet to have any player on the level of NBA greats like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant or Lebron James who play(ed) a huge part in boosting the popularity of the sport. </p>
