                <p>Of the top 100 best paid athletes in the world across all sports, only 2 of them are women. Both Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams make the Forbes highest paid athletes list (2020) at number 29 and 33.</p>
                
                <p>The only two women on the list are tennis players. This does not necessarily mean that there is equal pay within tennis, but it is a lot closer to equality than team sports like basketball. Tennis grand slam tournaments give equal prize money to men and women but out with those events women only earn around 80% of what men do from tennis (Connley, 2019). </p>
                    
                <p>
                US football is another sport that has an obvious pay gap with the average player on the national team earning $99,000 per year when the men were earning an average of $263,320 despite the women’s team bringing in more money than the men (Abrams, 2019). With basketball it can be explained well why women are paid less through revenue brought in by their league but with soccer that is not the case. 
</p>  
                <p>
                Female athletes that play solo sports do not have this problem as they are not under a contract, they get pretty much all their income from prize money and endorsement deals with companies that sponsor the sport. </p>

                <p>Across team sports whether it is basketball, football or baseball. Men bring in significantly more than women, partially because they are on entirely different contracts.</p>

                <p> Due to the lack of revenue from leagues like the WNBA, female athletes are usually signed under a collective bargaining agreement which means their income is more secure but also that it cannot go very high. Men are also signed on these agreements but tend to take less security for higher numbers. </p>
